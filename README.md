# Notes
scripts/7.dose_calc_jaw_ap_40x40_relaive.py - the discrepency between the clincial data and calculated dose are too big. Beam tunning (ernergy fluence, kernels) needs to be done. Also, the off axis correction seems necessary to take info account the variations of flattening filters as well as to adapt to FFF mode beams.
